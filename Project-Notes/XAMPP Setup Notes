The Problem
MySQL could not start because another program was using its default port, #3306. This caused an "Access denied" error in phpMyAdmin.

The Solution (2 Parts)
Part 1: Move MySQL to a New Port

We told MySQL to use a different, empty port (#3307) so it could start.

In XAMPP, click Config on the MySQL line and open my.ini.

Find the line:
port = 3306

Change it to:
port = 3307

Part 2: Tell phpMyAdmin Where MySQL Moved

We updated the phpMyAdmin config so it knew the new port number.

In XAMPP, click Config on the Apache line and open phpMyAdmin (config.inc.php).

Find the line:
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = '127.0.0.1';

Add this new line directly below it:
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] = '3307';

After saving both files and restarting Apache and MySQL, the problem was fixed.
