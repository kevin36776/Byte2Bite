# Kitchen Display (POC Update)

This folder contains the updated Kitchen Display System (KDS).  
It includes:
- `index.html` -- main KDS display with order navigation and status updates.  
- `history.html` -- completed order view and history tracker.  

Note 
The HTML files fetch order data from the local Flask server (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/...`).  
Anyone running their own backend should update API endpoints to match your environment and database.
